I am someone who spends a lot of time looking at computers,  studying how they work and programming them. There is no better feeling than writing code that is readable, concise, and efficient. The only thing that comes close is fixing a nasty bug. I enjoy studying traditional CS topics, as well as discovering recent developments in the field--I am always ready, able, and excited to learn new subjects and technologies in CS.\n\nMy current interests in the field are Systems Programming, Graphics Programming, Data Science, and Full Stack Web Development (this site was built with Vue.js). My open-source projects can be found at: [github.com/vinceniko](https://github.com/vinceniko). Selected projects are listed on this site and can be found on the navigation bar or by visiting the `Projects` page. I also write articles about projects / topics of interest--which can be found on the navigation bar under `Blogs` labels.\n\nWhen I'm not pursuing passions in CS, I may be reading, writing, exploring my city, and photographing it while doing so.\n\nIf you wish to get in touch and exchange ideas, you can reach me at ```<first name>.<last name> at gmail dot com``` (where the placeholders inside of <> get replaced with their proper values) or by selecting the mail icon adjacent to my name at the top of the page.\n"}}]);
